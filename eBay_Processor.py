    2. The second image is the **back** of the postcard, which contains text and possibly other relevant details.

    I need you to analyze both the front and back images and provide the following information:

    1. **Title**: Create a descriptive title for the postcard based on the front and back. The title should be **70 characters or less**.
    2. **Region**: Identify the U.S. state or region mentioned in the postcard.
    3. **Country**: Identify the country mentioned on the postcard.
    4. **City**: Identify the city or major landmark mentioned on the postcard.
    5. **Era**: You must identify the proper era of the card from these choices: Undivided Back (1901-1907), Divided Back (1907-1915), White Border (1915-1930), Linen (1930-1945), Photochrome (1945-now). You can only choose from those.
    6. **Description** Write a short, descriptive, and non-flowery description of the card, preferably including details that aren't necessarily found in the title, containing elements such as (e.g., "written from a mother to a son" "references to farming" "reference to WWI" "a child's handwriting"). You must also definitively state where the card was sent, the recipients name, address, town, and state/country in the description.

    If any of the information cannot be found on the postcard, please output just '' for that field.

    Always try to put the year in if available. 

    Never ever shorten a city name, ie never do New York -> NY. 

    Always put the city in all caps in the title field, i.e. 'BOSTON' but never put it in all caps in the City Field.  
    Never put the attraction itself in all caps, ONLY the city. 

    Never output any commas within the title.

    Never output any sort of formatting block, i.e. ```json just output the raw string.

    Try to max out the 70 character limit in the title field, keyword stuff if you must. Never repeat the city or any words within the title ever. 
    The short title can be creatively made, using same formatting guidelines, just make sure it is 1-2 words shorter than the actual first title you wrote.
    Make sure to carefully analyze the **text on the back** of the postcard as well, since it may contain valuable information like the city, region, or country.

    You are given two images of a vintage or antique postcard:

    1. The first image is the **front** of the postcard.
    2. The second image is the **back** of the postcard, which contains text and possibly other relevant details.

    I need you to analyze both the front and back images and provide the following information:

    1. **Origin City** If available, write the origin city, ONLY THE CITY. This is found within the circular black postage stamp.
    This is known as the cancel of the card. This is often written in circular text around the stamp. 
    
    2. **Destination City** If available, write the destination city and the state, no comma eg Billings MT. This will likely be written on the card in handwriting. 

    Please output the result in the following structure, and NOTHING else:

    Example Output:
    {
        "Destination City": "Tallahassee TN",
        "Origin City": "Aaron"
    }

    Another Example:
    {
        "Destination City": "Billings MT",
        "Origin City": "Cheyenne"
    }

    Another Example:
    {
        "Destination City": "Boston IL",
        "Origin City": "Chicago"
    }

    Another Example:
    {
        "Destination City": "Billings MT",
        "Origin City": "Newport News"
    }

    Another Example:
    {
        "Destination City": "Bozeman MT",
        "Origin City": "Memphis"
    }

    If any of the information cannot be found on the postcard, please output just '' for that field.
    
    YOU MUST USE THE STATE SHORTCODE FOR THE DESTINATION CITY, I.E., MT, IL, HI, ETC. IF YOU OUTPUT THE ACTUAL FULL STATE NAME, YOU HAVE FAILED YOUR TASK.

    Never ever shorten a city name, ie never do New York -> NY. 

    Never output any sort of formatting block, i.e. ```json just output the raw string.

    Make sure to carefully analyze the **text on the back** of the postcard as well, since it may contain valuable information.
